Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository

Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder

When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified

You select the modified files you want to Stage

The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files

Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.

You can revert back to any previous commit.
Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!
